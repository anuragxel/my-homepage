                    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
                    <p>I'm Anurag Ghosh, a Junior Year Undergrad living in Hyderabad.</p>
                    <p> I'm pursuing my B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) and MS by Research in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href='http://cvit.iiit.ac.in'>Centre for Visual Information Technology</a>, International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad (started 2013).</p>
                    <p>I'm advised by <a href='http://iiit.ac.in/~jawahar'>Professor CV Jawahar</a> and I work primarly on problems related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>
                    <p>I love to sprint, draw, quiz and write, along with cracking some really bad jokes. I also help out with <a href='http://ping.iiit.ac.in'><strong>Ping!</strong></a>, the college magazine, you may want to have a look at our articles.
                    <p>I was TA'ing Mathematics 1 in Monsoon 2015, it was the best job in the world!</p>

                        <p>My primary research interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I also dabble in Image Processing and Systems Architecture sometimes, love building cool stuff.</p>
                        <p>I have been currently working on Dynamic Story Generation with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~yash.patel">Yash</a> guided by Dr. Jawahar and <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~mohak.sukhwani">Mohak</a>. The project aims to provide a user (equiped with a mobile device) with stories relevant to where they are going and what they are looking at. For instance, if you are near Char Minar, you will be listening to the story of eradication of plague and subsquent construction of this landmark. <strong>(Gruesome example, I know, I know)</strong></p>
                        <p>I have been working on building Recommendation Systems with <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~aprit.merchant">Arpit</a> and <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~vatika.harlalka">Vatika</a>. The hybrid system involves aspects from Collaborative Filtering, Social Based and Content Based Filters to give diverse recommendations. The work is being reviewed at <a href="http://temporalweb.net">TempWeb'16</a> currently.</p>
                        <p>Earlier, me, <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~vatika.harlalka">Vatika</a> and <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~abhijeet.kumar">Abhijeet</a> were dabbling with Weakly Supervised Learning to Grade Essays Automatically. Hopeful of getting back to this sooner enough and making this more concrete.</p>
                        <p>It's like ancient history, but there was a time when I helped out in developing a Scene Text Translation Application. It worked on a KNN + Bag of Words scheme to retrieve the relavent sign board from our repository and thus the translation. We showed it off in Kumbathon, you can watch the <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~anurag.ghosh/demo_scene_translation.mp4">demo here.</a></p>

                    <p>Apart from my research projects, I have been pretty intensely involved in a Boost C++ project, where I'm building a <a href="http://github.com/anuragxel/boost-document">Document Automation Library</a> with the mentoring of Antony Polukhin. The Library automates many of the Excel/Libreoffice tasks, like making, filling and exporting spreadsheets in C++, is cross platform and well tested.</p>
                    <p>I am fond of another project, done with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~parth.kolekar">Parth</a>, a <a href="http://github.com/anuragxel/iiit-processor-simulator">teaching tool</a> for students of Digital Logic and Processors. It is a block level and cycle level simulator of a processor along with an intruction set assembler for the associated assembly language. The tool is currently a command line one and we are building a GUI for easier access. We previously took a <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~anurag.ghosh/MicroProgram_Sequencer.pdf">neat lecture on Microprogram Sequencers</a> for UG2k14, which was fun!</p>
                    <p>
                    <p>I built a system with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~romil.aggarwal">Romil</a> for very high dimensional fuzzy searching based on a very cool research paper which explains a two level scheme, clustering and then data oriented hashing. We tested it on the GIST dataset to great effect.</p>
                    <p>I have also built a couple of interpreters on my own, some for Esoteric Languages like Brainfuck and SNUSP, others for a lisp-like language I call vhisp based on <a href="http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/">this cool tutorial</a>. I also have a mini sql engine and a pretty fast external merge sort algorithm lying around just to exercise my C++ skills.</p>
                    <p>Of Projects that I'm not very fond of, there's the Attendance Infrastructure of IIIT-H which I have developed with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~yash.patel">Yash</a>. A nice and pretty <strong>safe</strong> android BookMyShow-esque application which communicates with a server to help a guy take attendance as all book keeping is now managed automatically. I have been jointly managing the Fresher's Registration Portal too, since the last two years.</p>

                    <p>I have been previously involved in the <a href="http://felicity.iiit.ac.in/threads">Threads team</a>, helping out with the platform and sometimes the questions. More recently, I have shifted my priorities towards <a href="https://felicity.iiit.ac.in/litcafe/">LitCafe</a> after hosting the <a href="https://felicity.iiit.ac.in/litcafe/litquiz/">LitQuiz</a> last year.</p>
                    <p>Apparently, we came runners up in a Microsoft Hackathon last year. That was wierd for me.</p>
                    <p> I have been pretty atheletic at times and can sprint if my life depended on it. (It does, quite some time.) I also very rarely play football, mostly favorably on the wings. In recent times, I have become someone behind the wings.</p>
                    <p>Somehow, I have a diploma of sorts in Fine Arts and can thus make some pretty okay drawings and sceneries. I drool over nice brushes and big paint sets, not forgetting those nice charcoal pencils.</p>
                    <p>I'm also a Student Welcoming Committee Member which I like being, hopefully the freshers are all happy this year by our efforts in integrating them.</p>
                    <p>Was a representative of UG2k13 in the Student's Parliament where I worked for changing the college laptop policy (which was modified for the upcoming batch), getting a batch hoodie made and handled a case of hostel violation.</p>
