                    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
                    <p>I'm Anurag Ghosh, a Junior Year Undergrad living in Hyderabad.</p>
                    <p> I'm pursuing my B.Tech and MS by Research in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href='http://cvit.iiit.ac.in'>Centre for Visual Information Technology</a>, <a href='http://iiit.ac.in'>International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad</a> (started 2013).</p>
                    <p>I'm advised by <a href='http://iiit.ac.in/~jawahar'>Professor CV Jawahar</a> and I work primarly on problems related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>
                    <p>I love to sprint, draw, quiz and write. I also help out with <a href='http://ping.iiit.ac.in'><strong>Ping!</strong></a>, the college magazine, you may want to have a look at our articles. I also contribute to the Open Source Initiative through my contribution to Boost C++ Libraries</p>
		    <p>I was coordinating <a href='http://felicity.iiit.ac.in/litcafe/'>Felicity LitCafe</a> in <a href='http://felicity.iiit.ac.in'>Felicity'16</a>. I'm currently coordinating student placement activities at IIIT Hyderabad along with handling fresher's induction program since last year.</p>
                    <p>I have TA-ed Discrete Mathematics (IMA101, a fresher's compulsary course) in Monsoon 2015, it was the best job in the world! Looking forward to another teaching stint this Monsoon semester. :)</p>

                        <p>My primary research interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I'm also interested in Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence, I love building cool stuff and working on exciting problems.</p>
                        <p>I have been currently working on Dynamic Narrative Generation with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~yash.patel">Yash</a> guided by Dr. Jawahar and <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~mohak.sukhwani">Mohak</a>. The project aims to provide a user (equiped with a mobile device) with stories relevant to a heritage site. For instance, if you are near Charminar, you will be listening to the story of eradication of plague and subsquent construction of this landmark. <strong>(Gruesome example, I know, I know)</strong></p>
                        <p>I have been working on building Recommendation Systems with <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~aprit.merchant">Arpit</a> and <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~vatika.harlalka">Vatika</a>. The hybrid system involves aspects from Collaborative Filtering, Social Based and Content Based Filters to give diverse recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Earlier, <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~vatika.harlalka">Vatika</a>, <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~abhijeet.kumar">Abhijeet</a> and I were dabbling with Spectral Learning to Grade Essays Automatically. Hopeful of getting back to this sooner enough and making this more concrete.</p>
                        <p>My first foray into Computer Vision was when I helped out in developing a Scene Text Translation Application. It worked on a KNN + Bag of Words scheme to retrieve the relavent sign board from our repository and thus the translation. We showed it off in Kumbathon, you can watch the <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~anurag.ghosh/demo_scene_translation.mp4">demo here.</a></p>

                    <p>Apart from my research projects, I have been pretty intensely involved in a Boost C++ Libraries funded project (through Google Summer of Code 2015 and subsequently in 2016, by Boost Steering Committee), where I'm building a <a href="http://github.com/anuragxel/boost-document">Document Automation Library</a> mentored by Antony Polukhin. The Library automates many of the Excel/Libreoffice tasks, like making, filling and exporting spreadsheets in C++, is cross platform and well tested.</p>
                    <p>I am fond of another project, done with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~parth.kolekar">Parth</a>, a <a href="http://github.com/anuragxel/iiit-processor-simulator">teaching tool</a> for students of Digital Logic and Processors. It is a block level and cycle level simulator of a processor along with an intruction set assembler for the associated assembly language. The tool is currently a command line one and we are building a GUI for easier access . We previously took a <a href="http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~anurag.ghosh/MicroProgram_Sequencer.pdf">neat lecture on Microprogram Sequencers</a> for UG2k14, which was fun! We are currently writing a handout explaining how simple processors work, message me if you have any good ideas! :)</p>
                    <p>I built a system with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~romil.aggarwal">Romil</a> for very high dimensional fuzzy searching based on a very cool research paper which explains a two level scheme, clustering and then data oriented hashing. We tested it on the GIST dataset to great effect.</p>
                    <p>I have also built a couple of interpreters on my own, some for Esoteric Languages like Brainfuck and SNUSP, others for a lisp-like language I call vhisp based on <a href="http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/">this cool tutorial</a>. I also have a mini sql engine and a pretty fast external merge sort algorithm lying around just to exercise my C++ skills.</p>
                    <p>I have been invovled in setting up the Attendance Infrastructure of IIIT-H which I have developed with <a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~yash.patel">Yash</a>. A nice and pretty <strong>safe</strong> android BookMyShow-esque application which communicates with a server to help a guy take attendance as all book keeping is now managed automatically. I have been managing the Fresher's Registration Portal since the last two years.</p>

                    <p>I was also a Student Representative of UG2k13 in the Student's Parliament. I worked on changing the college laptop policy (which was modified for the upcoming batch), getting a batch hoodie made and handled cases of hostel violation among other things.</p>
                    <p>I have been previously involved in the <a href="http://felicity.iiit.ac.in/threads">Threads team</a>, helping out with the platform and sometimes the questions. More recently, I have shifted my priorities towards <a href="https://felicity.iiit.ac.in/litcafe/">LitCafe</a> after hosting the <a href="https://felicity.iiit.ac.in/litcafe/litquiz/">LitQuiz</a> last year.</p>
                    <p> My team came runners up in a Microsoft Hackathon last year. That was a nice "learning" experience.</p>
                    <p> I have been pretty atheletic at times and can sprint if my life depended on it. (It does, quite some time.) I also very rarely play football, mostly favorably on the wings. In recent times, I have become someone behind the wings.</p>
                    <p>I have a diploma in Fine Arts and thus I can sketch well. I drool over nice brushes and big paint sets, not forgetting those nice charcoal pencils.</p>
